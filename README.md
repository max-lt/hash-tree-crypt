Hash Tree Crypt
===========================

Hash tree crypt is an experimental seekable stream cipher using a perfect binary tree to provide an infinite (quite large) one-time pad.

## Usage

### Build
```
make build
```

### Run

⚠️ The program **will overwrite you file**, as it is higly experimental for now we strongly recommmend that you use other ways to encrypt your data.

```
./target/release/hash-tree-crypt your-file-to-encrypt-or-decrypt
```
